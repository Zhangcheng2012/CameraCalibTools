# Calib [Win]

The software is using a printed page calibration sheet and the user has to select the surrounding region of a rectangular area of circle reference points‚Äù grid to perform the calibration.

# Camera Calibration 2.0 part of the MRPT project [Win64]

This GUI program allows users to find out the camera parameters of a camera by capturing several images of a checkerboard. The program allows online grabbing or images as well as selection of pre-recorded image files. It also shows the reprojected points, undistorted images and a 3D view of the reconstructed camera poses.

# Camera Calibration Tools

The application is largely inspired by the Matlab Camera Calibration Toolbox http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/ and it provides similar functionality in a stand alone application. Additional features include support for video devices and files. New functionalies such as automatic calibration object detection, hand-eye calibration, camera network calibration and self-calibration are in development for future releases.

You can find a chessboard pattern in https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/doc/pattern.png
You can find a circleboard pattern in https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/doc/acircles_pattern.png

If you want to create your own pattern, you will need python to use https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/doc/pattern_tools/gen_pattern.py

If you want to create a ChArUco board read tutorial Detection of ChArUco Corners in opencv_contrib tutorial https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d4a/tutorial_charuco_detection.html.
